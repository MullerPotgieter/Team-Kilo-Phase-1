	Limit Information Exposure 
	
			User passwords will be stored on the database using hashing algorithms, incase another party gets access to the database.

			User credentials will be validated on the client side (Java Script) and on the erver side (PHP).
				This will protect the system incase the information gets corrupted or intercepted during transfer.

			During validation we will also check that user input is not SQL injection code as an extra means of protecting information on the database.
