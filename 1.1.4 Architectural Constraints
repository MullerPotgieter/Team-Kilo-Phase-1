\subsection{Architectural Constraints}

\begin{flushleft}
		This section describes the architectural constraints that have been imposed by the client:
	
	\subsubsection{System Architecture}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	\textbf{Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE)}
			
		Provide an API and a runtime environment for the development and deployment of the research portal system. 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Particular Technologies}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Java}
		
	Used as the primary programming language for building and developing the Android application version of the system.
	Due to its concurrent, class-based, object-oriented implementation, with few dependency implementations and offers platform independence for the research portal.
	\end{itemize}
		
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{HTML 5 \& CSS3}
		
	Used to markup the layout and presentation of the research portal web page, with improved support for the latest multimedia and providing scripting APIs that can be used with JavaScript.
	\end{itemize}
		
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 	\textbf{Bootstrap (Front-end Framework)}
			
		Used for styling the research portal web page by utilizing HTML and CSS based design templates and  JavaScript extensions. 
		This will ease the development of research portal, to create a dynamic and responsive web page across different devices.
	\end{itemize}
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{Apache HTTP Server 2.4}	
	
	Used as the web server software that will process requests via HTTP for the distribution of information on the web.
\end{itemize}
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{JavaScript and jQuery}	
	
	Used for client-side validation of data before being sent server-side, with the use of jQuery JavaScript library, which is designed to simplify client-side scripting.
\end{itemize}
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{PHP 5.6}
		
	Provides improved support for object-oriented programming, PHP Data Objects (PDO) extension and performance enhancements over previous versions. 
	It will primarily be used for server-side validation of data and is also supported by Apache HTTP Server.
\end{itemize}
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{MySQL}
		
	Used as the relational DBMS for the storage of data into the database. 
\end{itemize}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Google Material Design}	
		
	Used to create the aesthetic design of the Android application, which allows for a single unified experience across platforms and device sizes.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsubsection{Operating Systems and/or Devices}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Desktop Independent Web Browser Compatibility}
	
	Since the research portal will primarily be accessed via the web, compatibility will be catered to most major browsers (Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, Opera). 
	
	Consequently, this allows for cross platform operating system compatibility for desktop operating systems (Microsoft Windows, Mac OSX, Linux) and mobile operating systems (Android, iOS, BlackBerry).
	\end{itemize}
	
\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{Android Application Compatibility}
		
	The Android application version of the research portal will be available for versions Android 4.0 IceCreamSandwich (API level 14) to Android 6.0 Marshmallow (API level 23).
	
	The application is intended for touchscreen mobile devices such as Android-compatible smart phones and tablets.
\end{itemize}
