Performance Tactics 

		Communication Channels
			Multi-threading will be used to ensure that more then one users can access the system at the same time.
			Caching will be used, to avoid continuios transmition of information from the server. This will allow more users to access information from thre system.

		Blocked Time 
			This system will allow 100 users to work concurrently, if more users try to access the system, their request will be blocked for a certain amount of time. 			(sceduling algorithms to be used).
