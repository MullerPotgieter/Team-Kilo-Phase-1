Reliability
		Resourse locking 
			Lock will be used to lock the section that the user is accessing/change so that no other thread/user changes the data while another user is still busy.
			
		Removal from service 
			If the user is inactive for longer then 5 minitus, the system will automatically log them out. 
				The state should be saved, so that when the users logs on again they continue from where they left off.
