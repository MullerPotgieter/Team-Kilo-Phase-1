\section{Integration and Access Channel Requirements}
\subsection{Human Access Channels}
The system should be accessible via the following channels:
\begin{itemize}
    \item An Android application compatible with all current and future versions of android.
    \item A web application or website that is compatible with all major browsers (Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome, etc)
    \item A desktop application available for both Windows and Linux.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{System Access Channels}
The system will be accessed via RESTful web services, that is, via the REST API that the server makes use of.

REST (Representation State Transfer)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Uses standard HTTP and is thus easy to use.
    \item Allows multiple data formats.
    \item Has support for JSON (which may prove vital in terms of our plans)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Protocols}
\begin{itemize}
    \item HTTP - Hypertext Transfer Protocol
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Used to transfer data, as well as respond to http requests.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item IP - Internet Protocol
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Allows Client-Server communication
        \item Handles sending and receiving data packets.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
