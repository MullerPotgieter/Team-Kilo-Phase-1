1.2 Architectural Patterns and Styles
This section describes the architectural patterns that will be employed by the project.
Some will be implicitly employed by the system as the system is being development.

  1.2.1 MVC Architecture 
This Architecture allows changing a systemâ€™s state, aided with the logical separation
of concerns; thus facilitating a consistent interface to subsystems that are responsible for different tasks.
The Model is interconnected with the Control, which is presented as an interface. The MVC can be broken down into 3 components.

  1.2.1.1 Model The model is the data storage (paper) component of the system and provides functionality 
  necessary to store data and perform CRUD operations on it, Database dependent.

  1.2.1.2 View The view is the outcome presented to the user, through the browser client and is delivered through the controller.

1.2.1.3 Controller The Controller is the controlling mechanism in the system which provides functionality and updates to the views of the 
system. Controller is through the main Server where most of the users send requests that are processed through to the View.

reasons to use MVC:
It produces a product to the end user up front, letting the user to only interact with the system through
encapsulation of those requests. Thus letting only the user be concerned with whats presented to them. 

1.2.2 Multitier architecture
  The multitier architecture to be implemented is the three-tier architecture as, it serves a client-server architecture.
  This allows the presentation, application processing and data management to be functions that are physically separated, 
  done at different ends.
  
  This architecture pattern provides a model that lets developers create flexible and reusable applications. 
  it can be broken down to 3 tiers, 
  
   1.2.2.1 Presentation tier(presentation) User interface; presenting information, tasks and results that the
    user can understand and make use of.
     
   1.2.2.2 Logic tier(application) processes commands, perform calculations, then providing a way to move processed data 
   between the surrounding tiers namely, Presentation and Logic.
     
    1.2.2.3 Data tier(Database)  this is where the information is stored, retrieved from a database system. making its way 
    to the logic tier, being processed in the logic tier then to the user interface.
